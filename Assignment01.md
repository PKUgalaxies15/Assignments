# Assigment 1

Due: End of class, 28 September 2015

1) **Install scientific Python.** If you don't already have Python (and associated scientific libraries) installed on your computer, do it! Whether you choose Python 2.7 or >3.3 is up to you.
You can try the instructions at [Python4Astronomers/Installing Scientific Python](https://python4astronomers.github.io/installation/python_install.html), or many other places online. 

2) **Become familiar with scientific Python.** Look at the [Python4Astronomers/Quick Tour](https://python4astronomers.github.io/intro/quick-tour.html). a) Do [Read a Table and Plotting](https://python4astronomers.github.io/intro/quick-tour.html#reading-a-table-and-plotting), b) [Curve Fitting with Scipy](https://python4astronomers.github.io/intro/quick-tour.html#curve-fitting-with-scipy), and c) [Synthetic Images](https://python4astronomers.github.io/intro/quick-tour.html#synthetic-images). Please save these plots as png or PDF. 

For basic learning, you can check out [Google's Python Introduction](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction), as well as many other resources online. 

3) **Manipulating galaxy images.** [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey](http://www.sdss3.org) is the largest public, homogeneous, digital sky survey. Using the [SDSS Science Archive Server](http://dr12.sdss3.org/), go to the Imaging->Single Fields and search for the galaxy M101. Download the u-band, g-band, and r-band FITS images (links below the color image). Use these images to make a color image following the instructions from the Python4Astronomers Quick Tour, [Make a Publication Quality Image](https://python4astronomers.github.io/intro/quick-tour.html#making-a-publication-quality-image). Save your color image. Does your color image look different from the one that SDSS produced? What are the wavelength ranges sampled by the u, g, and r bands? Think about what it means to make a color image.
