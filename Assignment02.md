Due: Beginning of class, 2 November 2015

Please make sure your homework has your name (both Chinese and pinyin). You are free to work with others in the class, 
but everyone should hand in their own assignment. You should submit it via email to me and Yiqing Liu (yiqing.liu@pku.edu.cn) in PDF format.

Determine the luminosity function, color distribution, and size distribution (per unit volume) for galaxies. Compare 
these ditributions in different environments.
