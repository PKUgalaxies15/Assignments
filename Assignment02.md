Due: Beginning of class, 2 November 2015

Please make sure your homework has your name (both Chinese and pinyin). You are free to work with others in the class, 
but everyone should hand in their own assignment. You should submit it via email to me and Yiqing Liu (yiqing.liu@pku.edu.cn) in PDF format.

1) Properties of galaxies (luminosity, size, color).
Determine the luminosity function, color distribution, and size distribution (per unit volume) for galaxies. Different data sets are at different distances (and redshifts). Remember that for redshift surveys, more luminous galaxies can be seen at larger distances, so you need to do a "Vmax" correction. For each luminosity bin, you need to know what the maximum volume in which the galaxy was observed.

Data sets:

[NASA Extragalactic Database](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu)

Local Group [e.g., McConnachie et al. (2012)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AJ....144....4M)
[Extended Virgo Cluster Catalog](https://sites.google.com/site/extendedvcc/)

[6dF Galaxy Redshift Survey](http://www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/6dFGS/)

[SDSS (median z~0.1)](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr12/en/home.aspx)

[GAMA](http://www.gama-survey.org/dr2/)

[DEEP2 Galaxy Survey (median z~1)](http://deep.ps.uci.edu/DR4/home.html)

2) Galaxy Properties as a function of environment

Take the luminosity, size, and color distributions you have derived above, and plot them as a function of environment. For local volume data sets, compare the Local Group and Virgo Cluster. Also, compare the inner regions of the Virgo Cluster (near M87 and M49) with the outskirts. For the other data sets, use local density as a proxy for environment. 

3) Redshift dependence.

Different groups should compare their results and see how these distributions change with redshift. Do you see evolution?
